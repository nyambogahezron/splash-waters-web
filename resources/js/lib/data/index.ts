        content: `
      Water quality is determined by various parameters that indicate its safety and suitability for different uses. Understanding these parameters is crucial for maintaining healthy water systems and ensuring safe drinking water.

      ## Key Water Quality Parameters

      ### 1. pH Level
      The pH level indicates the acidity or alkalinity of water. Ideal drinking water should have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5. Values outside this range can affect the taste and safety of water.

      ### 2. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
      TDS measures the total amount of dissolved substances in water, including minerals, salts, and metals. While some minerals are beneficial, high TDS levels can affect water taste and quality.

      ### 3. Turbidity
      Turbidity measures water clarity. High turbidity can indicate the presence of particles that may harbor harmful microorganisms or affect the effectiveness of disinfection processes.

      ## Impact on Health

      Understanding these parameters is essential because they directly affect:
      - Water taste and odor
      - Effectiveness of water treatment processes
      - Potential health risks
      - Equipment longevity

      ## Modern Monitoring Solutions

      Today's water purification systems use advanced sensors and real-time monitoring to track these parameters continuously. This ensures:
      - Consistent water quality
      - Early detection of issues
      - Optimal system performance
      - Compliance with safety standards
